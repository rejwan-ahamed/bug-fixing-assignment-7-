        <h1 class="questions-numbers">1. What is difference between local storage and session storage </h1>
        <p class="question-answers">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
            localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a
            document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to
            that particular tab.
        </p>
        <h1 class="questions-numbers">2. What is difference between global scope and block scope </h1>
        <p class="question-answers">In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while
            in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements,
            for statements, and the like.
        </p>
        <h1 class="questions-numbers">3. How javascript event loop works </h1>
        <p class="question-answers">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback
            Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it
            to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
        </p>
        <h1 class="questions-numbers">4. How many ways we get undefined in javascript </h1>
        <p class="question-answers">The undefined is a primitive type that has a single value undefined,
            Accessing an uninitialized variable returns undefined,
            Accessing a non-existing property of an object returns undefined,
            Accessing a out-of-bounds array element returns undefined,
            A function without a return statement or with a return statement but without an expression returns undefined.
